# HealthKit Export Extractor

This tool extracts data from the XML file available from the Health App on iOS and filters/outputs it in more useful formats. 

Currently, it exports weight data in CSV format to stdout. 

## Usage

`hkextract your-dump.xml > weight.csv`

## ToDo
- List all detected data types and allow specifying which to export
- Other output formats?
